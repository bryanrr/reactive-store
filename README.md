# Reactive Store
A reactive store using Spring Web Flux.  
The app is secured with Reactive Spring Security, providing a users datasource to identify users, in order to secure all of our endpoints.  
The app is acessing products information and sales information. All this information is gathered at a Mongo DB instance.  

>Note: In order to run the app, it's needed an external Mongo instance running, and the "autoservicio" database schema design on it.
